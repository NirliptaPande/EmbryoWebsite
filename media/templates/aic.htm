	<h3>What is Apogee Innovation Challenge?</h3>
		<p>
		Apogee Innovation Challenge is an event conducted BITS Embryo during <a href = "http://bits-apogee.org/intro/">Apogee</a>, International Technical Festival of BITS Pilani. Its a kernel event of the fest where we are inviting companies of various disciplines to pose a design challenge pertaining to their interest. Teams of students, across the country, will get around 1-1.5 months to solve your challenge and submit the solutions to the companies of their desired preference. The companies will decide the <b>best 5 solutions</b> pertaining to their requirements and <b>those teams will get a chance to present their idea in front of the company representatives during Apogee</b>. The winners can be awarded a cash prize, a summer/winter internship at your company or any goodies that the company may seem fit to felicitate them with.</p>
